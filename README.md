# Forest Fire Monitoring System 

A 4-wheeled rover uses an ESP32-CAM with OpenCV AI to detect fire and humans, sending data like temperature, humidity, smoke, soil moisture, and GPS location to ThingSpeak via ESP32. Controlled by Arduino UNO and L298N, it alerts authorities with real-time fire location using the NEO-6M GPS module.
